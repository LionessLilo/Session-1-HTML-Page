      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome! I started crocheting, like many others, while searching for a
        relaxing hobby to keep my hands busy during screen time. Tired of
        mindless scrolling, I craved a creative outlet that could also combat
        stress. What began with simple stitches in front of the TV quickly
        blossomed into a full-fledged passion. Now, I'm excited to share this
        journey with you. Dive in, grab your hook, and let's get creating!
